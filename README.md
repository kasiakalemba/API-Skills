# API Challenge - Basic Skills Demonstration

## Summary: 
This challenge focused on using API calls to generate weather data for multiple locations all over the world. The main goal was to see: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Skills Displayed: 
* Getting API requests 
* Converting JSON into python dictionaries 
* Generation of plots using Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook
* Using Google Maps and Places API to obtain information about geographic areas

## Part 1: WeatherPy 
Our task was to create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

First requirement was to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


Second requirement was to run linear regression on each relationship: 
* Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere 
* Then creating a multiple linear regression plots. 

## Part 2: VacationPy 
The task here was to create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from part I. Using those cities, the task was to narrow them down to your favorite weather conditions and choose your ideal vacation spot.
